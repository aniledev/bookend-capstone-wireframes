# Capstone Project--Bookend Full-stack Application

## About This Project

This project is a full-stack (client-side and server-side) application that allows users to search for book recommendations based on books they've already read and loved. The application will allow users to create a To Be Read list of their custom recommendations. Future implementation of the app will allow users to create profiles, log in, share books and their lists with each other. As an added bonus, I would also like this book recommendation application to also pair a coffee with the book recommendations as books and coffee go hand in hand. Further features might include allowing a user to write reviews or post comments about each book.
